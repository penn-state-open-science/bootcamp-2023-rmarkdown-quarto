## What's your project's bus number?

- Could a colleague regenerate/reproduce your work?
- *Methods reproducibility* [@Goodman2016-fi]
    - Precursor to/prerequisite for other kinds of reproducibility^[i.e., *replication*]

## DRY WIT

- **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself
    - Script/automate
    - Use functions
- **W**rite **I**t **D**own
    - It = what you did and how
    - In a form someone else can make use of

Your time and others' is valuable.

- One *tool*
- Transparent, reproducible, version-controlled
- Many outputs...

# Examples


# Background

## What is R Markdown?

- R Markdown [@allaire_et_al; @xie_allaire_grolemund; @xie_dervieux_riederer]
- Suite of R [@r-lang] packages that support "literate programming" [@Knuth1984-ot]

> Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained...

> ...and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.

## Don't worry

::: {.incremental}

- You don't have to be a programmer, or a good programmer, to use these tools!

- But using them will probably inspire you to become a programmer or a better one.

- And you don't have to use R. The tools support other languages^[bash, JavaScript, mysql, octave, ruby, sas, stata, fortran, python, etc.].

## Scripted data analyses/workflows

- vs. point and click
- Points and clicks can be hard to reproduce
    - SPSS graphic user interface (GUI) vs. syntax
- Computers do *exactly* what you tell them to do...
    - if you speak their language
    
## [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)

- Write human-readable text documents
    - Words, images, videos, web links
- Convert to computer-readable documents (.html, .pdf, .docx, .pptx)
- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) adds *executable computer code*

## Quarto

This talk was prepared using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. 
To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## RStudio

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python.  
It is a free and open source software program provided by [Posit](https://posit.co).

## GitHub

The files are rendered into a web site that is hosted on GitHub <https://github.com>.

GitHub is a web service for sharing computer code. It has a "pages" feature that also allows the (free) hosting of simple websites.

GitHub supports `git`, a computer program used to put documents under version control.
